Gomoku AI

To play agianst the AI, run "singlePlayer(x, y)" in main.py
Such that x would be the size of Gomoku Board (15 or 19 in regular Gomoku games)
While y is the model you want to play againt. 
There are four different models. Ranking them from hardest to easist would be: 0, 3, 2, 1
Once start them game, input the corrdinates you want to put the stone on in the format of "a b"

You can also let to models play agiants each other. I did that a lot to find the stronger model.
run "battleAI(x, y, z)" in this case. x would be the size of board. 
y would be the model number that draws the first move; and z would be the  model number for the other side.

Remeber that model 0 is the final model from this research. I would recommand playing against it and see how good you are at the game.
